Greasemonkey userscript for hiding empty tables in search results in phpmyadmin

In order to install my script:
1. Install greasemonkey / tampermonkey / other addon according to browser / preference
2. Browse file on my git you want to install (phpadminfilter.user.js / phpmyadminfilter_min.user.js - they are exactly the same, _min is minified version of original file)
3. Press "Raw" button on top of code window
4. Greasemonkey installation popup should appear
